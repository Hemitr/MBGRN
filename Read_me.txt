The folders contain the programs used to plot the different figures presented in the related IEEE Transactions on Education contribution.

They are not optimized from a computation programming point of view.

Files for both formulations:

1) Magnetic scalar potential formulation: Folders "Potential_U"

2) Mesh fluxes formulation: Folders "Flux"

have the same names.

It is advised that the readers rename them in order to avoid confusion.

Enjoy!
